# Portfolio page made with React

This project is a study method to use ESLint, Editorconfig, Prettier together with Create-react-app.

To make it happen (don't ask me why), I had to use node v16.14.0, wich I used nvm to install.

Then I installed @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@5.x and @typescript-eslint/parser@5.x to get eslint running properly.

# Styled Components

This project is also a study case on the usage of Styled Components.
